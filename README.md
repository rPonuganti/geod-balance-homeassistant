# GEOD Balance for Home Assistant

This custom integration for Home Assistant allows you to monitor the GEOD token balance of a Polygon wallet address using the Polygonscan API.

## About this fork
This is a fork of the original project to fix an issue that wasn't addressed due to inactivity. 
Iâ€™ve made the necessary changes for my use case and will try to maintain this fork as needed. Thanks to the original author for their great work!

## Features

- Fetches GEOD token balance for a specified Polygon wallet address
- Updates balance every hour
